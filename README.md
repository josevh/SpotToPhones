# SpotToPhones

<b>Goal:</b>
<br>
  A program that will connect to Spotify and read tracks in a playlist of your choice.
  The program will then connect to your Headphones server and see if you already have that track and album.
  If not, will download album and remove track from Spotify playlist.
<br><br>
<b>Status:</b> <b>WIP</b>
<ul>
  <li>Functioning, needs performance improvement.</li>
</ul>  
<br>
<b>Todo:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Move tracks that cannot be found on MBz to another playlist for cases in which manual download will be required.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Open to any suggestions. First real GitHub project for me.
Forgive the sloppy code, still learning.

Thanks for reading!

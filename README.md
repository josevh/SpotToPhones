# SpotToPhones

<b>Goal:</b>
<br>
  A program that will connect to Spotify and read tracks in a playlist of your choice.
  The program will then connect to your Headphones server and see if you already have that track and album.
  If not, will download album and remove track from Spotify playlist.

<b>Status:</b>

Open to any suggestions. First real GitHub project for me.
Forgive the sloppy code, still learning.
